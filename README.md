### About me: Cosmin Bacanu

I'm a self-taught dev living in Brasov, Romania that creates things that run or are viewed in a browser.


I've created 2 readme files:  
If you are even slightly amused by `[ $[ $RANDOM % 6 ] == 0 ] && rm -rf / || echo *Click*`, then read [this](./technical_people_readme.md).    
If not, read  [this](./recruiters_readme.md).  

Or read both, I can't really stop you.
