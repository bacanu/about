### Hello there!
Thanks for actually looking into my github profile. Because I receive a lot of offers that require experience 
in domains in which I have none or am not interested, I've made a list of technologies that you can search.   

If the technology has a ~~strikethrough~~ it means I have no experience AND I am not interested.  
If the technology has no "decoration", it means I am interested AND I have sufficient experience (at least 3 years)   

#### Interested and have experience:
- PHP (5.4 onward)  
- Javascript (not to be confused with ~~Java~~)  
- Laravel (4.2 onward)
- Vue.js
- Git
- REST APIs
- Html
- Css / Sass / Scss
- Mysql
- Vagrant / Homestead

#### Not interested:
- ~~Java~~
- ~~Python~~
- ~~Wordpress / WooCommerce~~
- ~~iOS~~
- ~~Android~~
- ~~Symfony~~
- ~~Magento~~
- ~~React~~
